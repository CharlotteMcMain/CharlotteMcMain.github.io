In our day-to-day lives, we mostly talk about temperature in terms of degrees celcius (deg C). This unit was first proposed by Anders Celcius in 1742 and is convient for everyday use as it defines the freezing and boiling points of water, at 0deg and 100deg respectively. 

For most people and in most applications, this is sufficient as it gives a good reference point to be able to compare things. However, a key detail that we usually omit, is the fact that these values are only true at 1 atmosphere of pressure. 

Famously, water on Mt. Everest boils at 68deg (https://www.lpi.usra.edu/education/explore/ice/background/allAboutWater/#:~:text=The%20boiling%20point%20of%20water,F%20(68%C2%B0C).) and as such, you can never cook a whole egg as, whilst the yolk cooks at 65deg, the outer white cooks at 85deg. And in the opposite vein, in a pressure cooker, water actually boils at 120deg. 

As such, you can see how, as we tackle increasingly complex physics and engineering problems, this scale from almost 300 years ago no longer fits our needs. We need a scale that is absolute - i.e., it does not change no matter the atmospheric conditions or properties of the object.

This is where our friend, Lord Kelvin, comes in.




Recap: remember Newton's First Law?

It says that:
<Callout variant="theorem" hideTitle>
'an object will remain at rest or with constant velocity unless acted upon by a resultant force'
</Callout>
So, when is an object's velocity *not* constant? 

When it's:
- Speeding up
- Slowing down
- Changing Direction

This makes sense because we remember that velocity is a **vector quantity** and, as such, it has both velocity <u>and</u> magnitude.
So even if our magnitude of velocity stays the same, if we change the direction of our object, we can say the velocity has changed.

Now, we need to remember another definition:
<Callout variant="theorem" hideTitle>
<div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
    **acceleration = change in velocity**
</div>
</Callout>



And by Newton's 2nd Law:
<Callout variant="theorem" hideTitle>
'the resultant force acting on an object with a constant mass is directly proportional to its accerlation'
</Callout>

In other words, if our object is experiencing an acceleration, then it must be experiencing a resultant force.

When we move in circular motion, this force is the **centripetal force**.

Now, a common misconception is that this is a *type* of force. But, centripetal is a describing word, and really any of our usual forces could be described as the centripetal force, depending on the situation.
E.g., if we are running around a running track, once we get to the corner, the force accelerating us is the friction force between our shoes and the floor.
If we swing a hammer, the centripetal force is the tension in the rope.
