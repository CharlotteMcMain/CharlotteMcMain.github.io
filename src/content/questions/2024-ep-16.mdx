  stem={`Thermistors are circuit components whose resistance varies with temperature.

There are two major types; negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistors, whose resistance
decreases with increasing temperature and positive temperature coefficient (PTC) thermistors,
whose resistance increases with increasing temperature.

A student is investigating how the resistance of a thermistor varies with temperature by
measuring current and voltage. The thermistor is placed in a water bath and the temperature of
the water measured using a thermometer.

The diagram below shows how the student set up the experiment (water bath not shown). The
circuit has been set up <b>incorrectly</b>.
