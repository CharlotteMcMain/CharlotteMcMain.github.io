  stem={`Thermistors are circuit components whose resistance varies with temperature.

There are two major types; negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistors, whose resistance
decreases with increasing temperature and positive temperature coefficient (PTC) thermistors,
whose resistance increases with increasing temperature.

A student is investigating how the resistance of a thermistor varies with temperature by
measuring current and voltage. The thermistor is placed in a water bath and the temperature of
the water measured using a thermometer.

The diagram below shows how the student set up the experiment (water bath not shown). The
circuit has been set up <b>incorrectly</b>.

            "Describe, using the graph and calculations using data from the table, how the resistance of the thermistor varies for increasing temperature. Hence determine whether the thermistor the student used was an NTC or a PTC thermistor.",
          marks: 3,
          explanation: `1. Describe what you see: As current increases, the temperature increases (whilst voltage remains constant).
            2. Using Ohm's law ($V = IR$), it is possible to calculate resistance, e.g. $R = \\frac{V}{I}$; therefore $R = \\frac{3}{0.75\\times10^{-3}} = 4\\,\\Omega$ and $R = \\frac{3}{2.8} = 1.1\\,\\Omega$.
            As such, we can see that as temperature increases, the resistance decreases.
            3. Reviewing our definitions:
            - **NTC (Negative Temperature Coefficient) thermistor** – resistance decreases as temperature increases
            - **PTC (Positive Temperature Coefficient) thermistor** – resistance increases as temperature increases
            Therefore, it is clear that this is an NTC thermistor.`,

            `The thermistor is used in a temperature-sensing circuit for a heating system to warm milk for a baby.
            
            The student considers two possible designs for the circuit which are shown below:

            />
            </span>
            
            In each circuit the voltage $V_{\\text{out}}$ across the thermistor is connected to the heating system for warming the milk.
            
            Discuss which circuit may be suitable for the heating system by considering the response of the circuit to changes in temperature.`,
          marks: 4,
          explanation: ` We remember our circuit rules. $V_\\text{in} = V_\\text{out}$. Therefore, the voltage will always remain constant across the thermistor.
          However, in circuit 2, a voltage divider is formed.
          A voltage divider basically means two resistors in series. Whilst the current is the same everywhere, the voltage is split across both components.
          So, in series, the total resistance is: $R_\\text{total}=R_1+R_2$.
          Using Ohm's law: $V = IR$ therefore $I=\\frac{V}{R}=\\frac{V}{R_1+R_2}$.
          To get the voltage across the thermistor, we are looking for V_\\text{out}. This means: $V_\\text{out}=I\\times R_2$.
          Substituting our expression for current: $V_\\text{out}=(\\frac{V_\\text{supply}}{R_1+R_2})\\times R_2$.
          Therefore, if we now consider that $R_2$ changes, we will see a change in the voltage.
