Fig.1 shows two capacitors, **A** of capacitance $2\ \mu \text{F}$, and **B** of capacitance $4\ \mu \text{F}$, connected in parallel. 
Fig. 2 shows them connected in series. A two-way switch **S** can connect the capacitors either to a d.c. supply, of e.m.f. $6\ \text{V}$, or to a voltmeter.

### (a)
Calculate the total capacitance of the capacitors

#### (i)
when connected as in Fig. 1

#### (ii)
when connected as in Fig. 2

### (b)
The switch in the circuit shown in Fig. 1 is then connected to the battery.
Calculate
#### (i)
the potential difference across capacitor **A**
#### (ii)
the total charge stored on the capacitors.

### (c)
The switch in the circuit shown in Fig.2 is then connected to the battery. 
Calculate the total energy stored in the two capacitors.

### (d)
The switch S in the circuit of Fig. 1 is moved to connect the charged capacitors to the voltmeter. The voltmeter has an internal resistance of $12\ \text{M}\Omega$.
#### (i)
Explain why the capacitors will discharge, although very slowly.
#### (ii)
Calculate the time *t* taken for the voltmeter reading to fall to a quarter of its initial reading.

## Mark scheme

### (a)
#### (i)
$C_p = 2+4 = 6\ \mu\text{F}$
#### (ii)
$\frac{1}{C} = \frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}$
$C_s = \frac{4}{3}=1.33\ \mu\text{F}$

### (b)
#### (i)
$6.0\ \text{V}$
#### (ii)
$Q=C_pV=6\times 6=36\ \mu\text{C}$

### (c)
$E=\frac{1}{2}C_sV^2=24\times 10^{-6}$

### (d)
#### (i)
The capacitors discharge through the voltmeter
#### (ii)
$V=V_0e^{-\frac{t}{CR}}$
$\frac{1}{4}=e^{-\frac{t}{(6\times12)}}$
$\ln{4}=\frac{t}{72}$
$t=72\ln{4}\approx 100\ \text{s}$
