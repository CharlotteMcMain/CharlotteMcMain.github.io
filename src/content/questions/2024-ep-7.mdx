  Radiation is governed by the decay equaton:
  $$\text{Activity}, A = \lambda N$$
  where:
  - $A$ = rate of decay (activity)
  - $\lambda$ = decay constant
  - $N$ = number of undecayed nuclei

  Going through each statement:
  1. '<i>Rate of decay is depedendent on the decay constant.</i>'
  This is true because our equation shows that as lambda changes, A changes.

  2. '<i>Rate of decay is independent of the mass of the source.</i>'
  The mass determines how many nuclei $N$ that you start with, so if $m$ changes, $N$ changes and therefore $A$ changes.

  3. '<i>Rate of decay is dependent on time.</i>'
  $$A(t)=A_0e^{-\lambda t}$$
