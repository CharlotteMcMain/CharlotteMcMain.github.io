A car accelerates uniformly along a straight road.

### (a)
The speed increases from $10\,\text{m s}^{-1}$ to $22\,\text{m s}^{-1}$ in $6\,\text{s}$.
Calculate the acceleration.

### (b)
Explain why the acceleration would not remain constant if the driving force stayed the same as speed increases.

## Mark scheme

### (a)
$$
a=\frac{22-10}{6}=2\,\text{m s}^{-2}
$$

### (b)
As speed increases, resistive forces increase, reducing the resultant force.
Since $a=F/m$, acceleration decreases.

## Explanation

### (a)
This is a standard uniform acceleration question: use $a=\Delta v/\Delta t$.

### (b)
Even if the engine force is constant, drag increases with speed, so the resultant force falls and acceleration decreases.
