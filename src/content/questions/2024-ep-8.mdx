  stem="A student is using a spreadsheet to model the decay of charge on a capacitor. They are using the equation $\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}=-\frac{Q}{2.5}$. The student chooses a time interval of $0.5\text{ s}$. At time $t=0.0\text{ s}$ the charge on the capacitor is $600\ \mu\text{C}$. Part of the modelling spreadsheet is shown below. What is the charge on the capacitor at $t=1.5\ \text{s}$?"
