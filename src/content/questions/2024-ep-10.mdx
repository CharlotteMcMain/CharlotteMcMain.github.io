  stem="A student uses the circuit below to determine the electromotive force (e.m.f.) and internal resistance of a battery. They measure the current and potential difference (p.d.) across the variable resistor for different resistor values. A graph is drawn with p.d. on the y-axis and current on the x-axis. Which row is correct for calculating the e.m.f. and the internal resistance of the battery?"
  options={[
    { id: "A", label: "magnitude of gradient | intercept on y-axis" },
    { id: "B", label: "magnitude of $\frac{1}{\text{gradient}}$ | intercept on y-axis" },
    { id: "C", label: "intercept y-axis | magnitude of $\frac{1}{\text{gradient}}$" },
