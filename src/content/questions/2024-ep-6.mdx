  **Amplitude** = 

  1. Count the number of squares for the half the wave: 3.5 squares.

  2. Each square is worth 0.5V therefore, the amplitude is no. squares times 0.5V = $3.5\times0.5=1.75V
  
  **Frequency** = 

  We can use the relationship: $f=\frac{1}{T}$, where $\text{T}$ is the period of the wave (the time taken to complete 1 cycle). 
  Measuring this, we get 1 wave is 4 squares. Each square is worth 0.1s therefore $T=4\times0.1=0.4s$. Therefore, $f=\frac{1}{0.4}=2.5\text{Hz}$.
