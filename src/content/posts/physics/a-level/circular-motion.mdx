Recap: remember Newton's First Law?

It says that:
<Callout variant="theorem" hideTitle>
'an object will remain at rest or with constant velocity unless acted upon by a resultant force'
</Callout>
So, when is an object's velocity *not* constant? 

When it's:
- Speeding up
- Slowing down
- Changing Direction

This makes sense because we remember that velocity is a **vector quantity** and, as such, it has both velocity <u>and</u> magnitude.
So even if our magnitude of velocity stays the same, if we change the direction of our object, we can say the velocity has changed.

Now, we need to remember another definition:
<Callout variant="theorem" hideTitle>
<div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
    **acceleration = change in velocity**
</div>
</Callout>



And by Newton's 2nd Law:
<Callout variant="theorem" hideTitle>
'the resultant force acting on an object with a constant mass is directly proportional to its accerlation'
</Callout>

In other words, if our object is experiencing an acceleration, then it must be experiencing a resultant force.

When we move in circular motion, this force is the **centripetal force**.

Now, a common misconception is that this is a *type* of force. But, centripetal is a describing word, and really any of our usual forces could be described as the centripetal force, depending on the situation.
E.g., if we are running around a running track, once we get to the corner, the force accelerating us is the friction force between our shoes and the floor.
If we swing a hammer, the centripetal force is the tension in the rope.
